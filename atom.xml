    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Wow, does this actually work?</h3>

<p>So, it turns out that writing a blog post in markdown is actually kind of nice. I enjoy the simplicity of it. And the FoldingText app makes it even nicer. I feel I am about as close to a typewriter as I can get while working on a $3000+ shiny metal laptop.</p>

<p>Figuring out the templating process is a bit daunting, and I find myself wondering if I should be devoting time to yet another new thing, while my &#8220;real&#8221; website, <a href="http://fstopdesign.com">fstopdesign.com</a> languishes in its perpetually half finished state like the house of a contractor.</p>

<p>The designer in me badly wants to tweak and customize the design of this default template, but that&#8217;s where I stop short because I know I could spend days figuring out this system, and is it worth it?</p>

<p>I have finally gotten to a pretty fluent state with my WordPress theming and developing knowledge, so why would I want to go off and start over with something that&#8217;s totally new, and rather difficult to learn?</p>

<p>Well, the big attraction for me is the simplicity of the static site that these static site generators generate. I love WordPress, but honestly, the thought of serving up some simple, static, pre rendered HTML/CSS/JS files is very appealing after dealing with with the dynamic soup that is WordPress.</p>

<p>Then there is the fact that I&#8217;m actually, at this exact moment, doing something that I have been thinking about doing, urging myself to do, feeling bad that I have not been doing for a very long time: writing. It&#8217;s funny, I can feel my hands getting a bit tired from this little bit of typing. But it feels great!</p>

<p>Probably what I&#8217;ll do is let my inner designer suffer slowly as I continue to use this Octopress thing to write with first and figure out how to make it look like my own thing later.</p>

<p>I have to say, publishing a post with a <code>rake deploy</code> command in the terminal feels kinda cool.</p>
